#KudoMessage - Erland

##What is Erland?
Erland is a take on making a desktop application for KudoMessage.

##What does it do?
The way Erland is built is very much as a desktop experience of Jessica, the web application. In fact you could say it is 
a very simple web browser which can only display Jessica, and you would be very much right.

But Erland add to the experience of using Jessica. It uses native ways to notify you when ever somebody want your attention, 
and play some nice sounds too. But really it delivers a far more cleaner version of Jessica, without all the unnecessary things 
a ordinary web browser add, nice to skip all that, huh?

###How does it do it?
####Jessica
The way Erland brings Jessica to the desktop is by using a very small and very nice web page render engine called WebKit, 
it's the same that Google Chrome and Apple Safari uses.
